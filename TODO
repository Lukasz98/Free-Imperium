I.   Sometimes font renders a little blury, usually it happens if it's x position is close to .5f

II.  Identifying peace offer proposition icons on side bar.
     Now we can delete for ex war icons, becasuse they are identified
     by two factors: [war icon], [war id].
     Peace offers requires one more: id of sender.
     This problems lays in List::DeleteGroup(int, int)

III. Z factor of windows:
     * each window should have its own range of z, so that no other window interence (displaying),
     * detecting mouse clicks on window thats on top.

IV.  Redrawing country borders after accepted peace offer is sometimes buggy.

V.   Correct displaying "mouse marked" provinces (ex. while selecting to peace offer or just clicking to spawn prov window).
     It breaks when map needs to be redrawn for ex. after peace offer.

     ADD 1. Now marked provinces through peace offer window, should be unmarked if peace was related to window's war, and window itself should be closed.
            If non related war was ended, marked provs for peace offer should be sustained.
            Now work should be done on restoring marked province that was clicked in order to open prov window (restoring after peace offer)

     ADD 2. Now all seems to work. 
     
     DONE.

IV.  Marking province that is occupied has no graphical effect. Also switching to occupied state make, province mark disapear.
     
     ; propably it's a problem in last if in frag shader.
